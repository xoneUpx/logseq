- both commands create subshells:
	- command subsititution:`` $()`` processed as stdin
	- process substition: ``<()`` processed as file descriptor; suitable for commands/processes that take file as input
- run command in subshell to apply sudo to the whole command:
	- `` sudo bash -c 'echo "lol" > /some/file/that/user/has/no/access/to'`` - this effectively runs the whole command as sudo
	- ``sudo echo "lol" > /some/file/...`` - /some/file/... is created without sudo before being open for writing
